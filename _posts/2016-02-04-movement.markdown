I step out of the hardware store, take in a brisk breath of cold air, and look out across the street.  McDonalds, Autozone and Pizza Hut signs hang in the air like heavy, gaudy necklaces.  As I walk back to my car, each step in the parking lot is more plodding than the last.  I get in my subcompact Honda Fit and drive past the trucks like a jeep past towering sequoias.

The washing machine discharge hose was leaking, and Home Depot's replacement hose was not long enough.  Like any good trip to a home repair store, it was followed quickly by a trip to the same repair store.  And so, bags empty, I drive away from Home Depot.

With each trip and re-trip to Home Depot, I get a little less bad at home repair and DIY stuff.

I leave Home Depot, and head to Lowe's; the search for the long-enough hose continues, long after I think *that this should be simpler*.  McDonalds is substituted by Ruby Tuesday, but the signs outside the store and the flourescent lights are similar.  Lowe's is out of the hose I'm looking for, but at least they have an empty cardboard box on the shelf.  They used to have it!  Elation at my success is replaced by frustration that it isn't immediate.  Lots of people are, like me, getting a little less bad at home washing machine repair, it seems.  I walk out of the store, plodding my feet into the parking lots.

As I drive my car past the steel and diesel sequoias, I put on "I Dreamed A Dream."  Back home, to tell my wife that we'll need to put a bowl beneath the leaky hosy for the next few days.  My voice is an octave or two down from Patti LuPone.

As I drive home, I get a little less bad at singing, and my mood moves from exasperated to happy.  And things are suddenly ok.
