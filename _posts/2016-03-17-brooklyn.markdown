My baby presses herself against my chest. Why, Irene? Why? We were going to the park for you! We were going to the park so that you could run around and play! You're not supposed to fall asleep in the baby carrier! Don't you know how this works?

So I sit outside a crepe and juice bar, the sub pressing against my face through 40 degrees F winds, bundling my sleeping child close to my chest. I drink my mango smoothie, and look at the traffic going by.

I sit in Brooklyn, contemplating how it is like and unlike the other places I have been. And it is different only in so much that I have a child to remind me about what I find more pressing that the weather or the culture.

Is it like Manhattan? LA? Boston? Columbus? Seattle? I will tell you: Brooklyn is like my daughter sleeping against my chest.

She turns her head, *not caring one iota about my comfort*, and I am happy.

Also, the mango smoothies are tasty.
