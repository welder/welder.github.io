On my inaugural visit, one of the last things I did in New York City was run through the streets of Chelsea and up a small corridor of Manhattan to the doors of Penn Station.

Let's back up a second.  Story time!

------------------------

A dear friend of mine once told me an amusing anecdote about his mother while in Los Angeles International Airport.  As his mother waited at baggage claim, a nice foreign woman came up and asked how to get to this place in America she's heard of called Arizona.  My dear friend's mother replied that, well, you find the 10 freeway and drive for 9 or so hours.  The nice foreign woman's confused response was,

"No, not that far.  *Arizona*.  I hear it's just one state over."

------------------------

I try not to be beholden to itineraries when I travel.  Instead, I try to pick two or three things I'd like to see, do, or try, and I just let the rest of it wash over me like the tide.  Unfortunately for my sanity, I decided that I wanted to try a *real New York slice of pizza* sometime during my first trip -- and then neglected that idea until the morning we were leaving.  We waited for our train at Penn Station and as we waited, I asked a few guys about how to get to a pizzeria.  Turns out any given gaggle of New Yorkers is attached to a multitude of opinions.

No, forget that one, you want this one.

He's crazy, listen, here's where you go.

Your first slice?  How could you go anywhere but there?

And then it's settled as quick as it started -- and they've settled on 20th Street, apparently.

*But can I make it back in time*, my lovely and charming wife asks me.  *Can I make it back in time?*  So I reassure her.

"Our train isn't boarding for 15 minutes.  It's not that far.  Joe's Pizza?  I hear it's just 10 blocks away."

And out the doors of Penn Station I set off on a brisk walk.  I have the confidence of a man who's just asked for directions, then assured his travel party that he knows where he's going.  I am secure in the knowledge that I would return to my newborn child and anxious wife with plenty of time to spare.

--------------------------

So there I am, right, dashing up 8th Avenue, pizza box tucked in like a precious football because there are only seconds left on the clock.

Turns out small pockets of America can be bigger than *a lot* of people think.
